# Growth Mindset

You know when you've got important things to do and you're feeling **nervous**? Convert that nervousness into ***CONFIDENCE & EXCITEMENT!*** When taking a challenge head on, you shall arise to the occasion & strike it down with glorious fortitude.

1. Faced by an obstacle? Can't find your way over it? Maybe try going around it instead! Explore new options when stumped.
2. Struggling is not always bad - without pain there is often no gain! *But don't forget to ask for help after 15 minutes!*
3. Observe & celebrate others' success and find inspiration for your own growth.
