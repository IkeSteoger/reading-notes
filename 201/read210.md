## Debugging

### Troubleshooting JavaScript

Syntax errors are spelling errors in your code that cause the program not to run or stop partway through. Easy to fix with the right tools.

Logic errors are rorrs where the syntax is correct but the code is not what you intended meaning the program runs successfully but is giving incorrect results. Usually harder to fix as there isn't an error message often.

(Mozilla.org)

I feel like I've had almost all the errors under the sun then I find a new one each day! Hahah. But often my errors are simple things like I forgot a comma or a parathesis or something similar. I usually use the console log to find out what line its coming from & button that up.

This topic will influence my long term goals in many ways - sometimes debugging could be my entire job/project!

### JavaScript Debugger

The JS debugger will allow you to view your code as it is running to see the value of variables you've set and set up points to stop your code to identify issues.

A breakpoint is a place in which you want to pause the code execution. Usually to identify issues or see the value of a variable.

The call stack is a section that shows you what code was executed in order to get the current line (Mozilla.org)

## Things I want to know more about

How powerful is the debugger? Is this extremely widely used, like with almost all JavaScript or just on occasion?
