## CSS Transforms, Transistions, Animations

### CSS Transforms

A CSS Transform allows an developer to edit an element in multiple ways such as scale, rotation, changing perspective, and more!

The `translate` feature of `transform` would allow you to do things similar to relative positioning, like pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the flow of the document.

### CSS Transitions and Animations

A CSS transition allows a developer to change an element based on a certain event, such as hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

Animations main difference between transitions is it has multiple states that change rather than a single state change.

Some benefits to using CSS transitions include: wowing your users, attracting their view, and creating a interactive website.

This topic fits in with my long-term goals of continuing to learn new ways to alter webpages that create a positive - either better viewing experience or readability, etc.

## Psychological Safety

Three key factors of psychologically safe teams include:

- we must know that we can be free enough to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations
- we must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations
- we want to know people are actually listening to us
- we want to know that work is more than just labor

I would say my last job at a cannabis retail store was and was not psychologically safe - while the general feel of fellow co-workers was always cordial and kind, there was always a bit of a rift between upper management and the floor employees. Both groups had the opinion that the other was not doing enough to help with day to day activities. This created a festering and poor workplace environment where most people would just attempt to never mention work and just talk about everything else.

I think that teams with a high degree of psychological safety will see longer tenure from their employees, inspiring other teams to do similar, and create a good culture of taking care of our people in order to take care of the company.


## Things I want to know more about

How many companies actually value psychological safety? First I'm hearing of it!
