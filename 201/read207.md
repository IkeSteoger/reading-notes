## Object Oriented-Programming & HTML Tables

### Domain Modeling

The reason we need domain modeling is to verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem. As a communication tool, it defines a vocab that can be used within & between both technical & business teams. (Github.com)

### HTML Tables

Tables should not be used for page layouts because the cells & rows are always aligned with each other & wouldn't be able to be modified in the same way we use HTML Box Model.

Different Semantic HTML Elements used in an HTML `<table>`

>- Headers `<th></th>` which are used to title the cell/row its assigned to.
>
>- Cells `<td></td>` are the contents of the table cell.
>
>- Rows `<tr></tr>` are the contents of a table row.

A constructor is used to create multiple objects and can be used to add a new property to multiple objects.

When using `this` in the object literal it would use that exact object literal and change within it. When using it in a constructor, it will work inside of whatever object it might be placed in.
