## HTML Media & More CSS Learning

### HTML Media

`alt` text on a website is used for many reasons, such as a screen reader, showing you if you misspelled the file pathing, the browser might not support the image type, and search engines can match alt text with searches.

Using the `alt` tag in as many places as possible to describe to users what is there would help the accessibility of your website.

You might use the `<figure>` tag to add a caption to your image, also via use of the `figcaption` which would place the caption near the image.

The main difference between a `gif` and a `svg` is that `gif` is used for simple images & animation. The `svg` tag is used for icons, diagrams, and other things that must be drawn accurately at different sizes. It uses the vector image format.

To display an image on my website I think I would prioritize `png` type as they have a wide support amongst browsers & has a very high reproduction of source images.

### More CSS: Color & Styling HTML Text Elements

The foreground color aka `color:` changes content in the front of the HTML element, often text or something similar. The background color aka `background-color:` will fill the back layer of the element, usually the background.

You can use color in a number of ways to spice up a website - for a blog I would most likely give the text a lighter color that pairs well with a darker background, because I'm a big fan of Dark Mode style websites. This is a personal preference, and we could even make a dark/light mode style of his website, perhaps using a lighter background & darker text color for the light mode.

When choosing fonts for an HTML document you want to make sure you use a Web Safe Font - there are only a certain number of fonts generally available across all systems & browsers.

`font-size:` will affect the actual size of the text.

`font-weight:` will affect the the boldness of the text. There are many values but often you'll just use `normal` & `bold`.

`font-style:` will turn italic text on or off. `normal` or `italic`

Two ways to add spacing around the actual characters with in an `<h1>` would be either `letter-spacing:` which affects the actual space between letters or `word-spacing:` which affects the actual space between words.
