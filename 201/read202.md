## HTML Fundamentals

It's important to use semantic elements in HTML because it can give the content correct meaning, function, and appearance. `<h1>` is a semantic element, for example.

There are 6 levels of headings, `<h1>` through `<h6>`.

The superscript tag `<sup>` can be used to to properly format the 1st of the Month, making the st small and floating to the top of the text. It can also be used for mathematics and sciences.

The subscript tag `<sub>` can be used to properly format chemical formulae and math, creating a small number floating to the bottom of the text.

When using the `<abbr>` element, you can assign a `title=""` to provide a full expansion on the abbreviation.

## CSS Structure

There are three main methods of applying CSS: inline styles, internal stylesheet, and external stylesheet.

Inline is not only the worst for CSS maintenance, it also makes the HTML harder to read & understand.

In the block of code provided, `h2` is the selector, `color` & `padding` are considered properties, while `color: black; padding 5px;` is considered the CSS declaration.

Data enclosed in single or double quote marks is considered a `String`.

Four Types of Operators in JS: (as defined by Mozilla)

- `+` (Addition)
- `=` (assignment! perhaps the most important)
- `===` (strictly equal to, no exceptions)
- `!==` (does not equal to - can also be `!`)

There are tons of real world problems you could solve with a function - and many websites do! CAPTCHAs, password verification, etc. Some simple things you could do is create a math equation and try many different variables within the equation very quickly, giving you an idea of what might occur if you were to use the equation.

## Decisions in Code: Conditionals

An if statement checks a `variable` and if it evaluates it to `true`, the code will execute until it evalutes to `false`

The use of `else if` adds another `if` to the statement if the original `if` does not evaluate to true.

Examples of JavaScript comparison operators: (as defined by W3 Schools)

- `==` (Equal to)
- `!=` (Not equal to)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)

The operator `&&` means this AND that but the `||` operator means this OR that! Don't forget!
