## React and Forms

A 'Controlled Component' is an input form element whose value is controlled by React by using user input.

We should update state with their responses as soon as they enter them so that we could do things like instant input validation, input formatting and other features.

To target what the user is entering with an event handler on the input field you would want to use something like `event.target.name`.

## Conditional (Ternary) Operator

The use of ternary operator is to shorten your if statements into one line of code.

`if(x===y){`
`  console.log(true);`
`} else {`
`  console.log(false);`

`console.log(x===y ? 'true' : 'false');`
