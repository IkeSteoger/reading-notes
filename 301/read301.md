A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementiation and exporting it as a higher level interface (tutorialspoint.com)

Component characteristics include

- Reusability
- Replaceable
- Not context specific
- Extensible
- Encapsulated
- Independent

(tutorialspoint.com)

Component advantages include

- Ease of deployment
- Reduced cost
- Ease of development
- Reusable
- Modification of techinical complexity
- Reliability
- System maintenance and evolution
- Independent

### Props and how to use in React

Props is short for properties, which is used for passing data from one component to another.

Props are used in react to define the attribute and its data, then passes it to the child components via Props, and then finally renders the Props Data (itnext.io)

Props flow down to the child components but not in the opposite direction. That being said, a previous parent can call upon child components and update all other children.
