## Functional Programming

>What is functional programming?
>>Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

>What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
>>It returns the same result if given the same arguments, and it does not cause any observable side effects.

>What are the benefits of a pure function?
>>The code is easier to test!

>What is immutability?
>>Data that cannot change after it's created

>What is Referential transparency?
>>`pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency!` If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input

## Node.JS

>What is a module?
>>They contain different sets of code that can be called upon when we need them (feels like a component?)

>What does the word ‘require’ do?
>>`require` will let you use the code within the module elsewhere

>How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
>>Must flag which part of the module we want to make available - `module.exports = function`

>What do we have to do to make a module available?
>>We have to set the module equal to a variable so that it can be called

## Things I want to know more about

What's different of module vs component? Seems similar!
