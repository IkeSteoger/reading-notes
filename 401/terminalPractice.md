# 401 Prep Work: Practice in the Terminal

## Observations

### The Command Line

This mentions bash but when running `echo $SHELL` I receive `/usr/bin/zsh` but nothing about Bash. Is this wrong?

### Basic Navigation

Tab completion is HUGE! Wish I had known this trick earlier.

### More About Files

You can use spaces in file names - but must use an `\` escape character or `""` quotation marks.

### Manual Pages

Using the `man <command>` will show a manual page for the command. You can also search through manual pages for a specific search term via `man -k <search term>`.

### File Manipulation

I knew of `mkdir` and `touch` to create new folders but didn't know about using `cp [options] <source> <destination>` to copy files/folders which is different from `mv` to move files/folders. `rmdir` and `rm` cannot be undone - triple check its right!!

### Summary

The terminal is a extremely powerful tool that can be used very efficiently if you know what you're doing. Use of the cheat sheet will be key to learn the ins and outs.
