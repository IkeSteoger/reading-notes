## Data Modeling

### What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?

SQL Database

### What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL Database

### Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend

SQL databases are powered by one computer, which can be upgraded, and NoSQL are easier to upgrade by adding more computers.

### Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?

Lines connect to show relationships and some relationships in data tables can be related to more entry than one.

### Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to \_\_\_ a \_\_\_ of the database tables and their relationships

Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to create a data model of the database tables and their relationships.

### Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key

Primary keys uniquely identify each row in a table.  
Foreign key is a column or set of columns which match a primary key in another table.

### How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?

Keywords are FULL CAPITALS and are basic with SQL syntax but parameters must be created.

### Define normalization within the context of schemas and data

Normalization means columns are assigned to tables in such a way that each item is only stored once, aka no duplicate data.

### Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter

One-to-one: one item in the table is related to one item in another table.
one-to-many: one item in the table is related to many other items in another table.
many-to-many: many items in the table are related to many items in another table.

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README

Same as always - try to properly comprehend & actually learn rather than copy demo code.
