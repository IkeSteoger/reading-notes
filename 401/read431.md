### [Choosing the State Structure](https://react.dev/learn/choosing-the-state-structure)

#### Summarize the five principles for structuring state

1. Group related State
2. Avoid contradictions in state
3. Avoid redundant state
4. Avoid duplication in state.
5. Avoid deeply nested state.

### [Passing State Deeply with Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)

#### What problem do Contexts aim to solve?

Passing props & prop drilling. You can "teleport" data to the components in the tree that need it without passing props.

#### What is one technique to try before useContext?

Start by passing props or extract components and pass JSX as children.

#### What hook complements useContext for complex applications?

`useState` (I think)

### Things I want to know more about
