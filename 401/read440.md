### Ethics in the workplace

#### [Amazon workers demand Jeff Bezos cancel “Recognition” software](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-workers-demand-jeff-bezos-cancel-face-recognitio-1827037509)

This shows how important ethics of the employees are. They can affect their overall company & make fundamental changes in the workplace. I am impressed that they were willing to take it directly to Jeff Bezos. I am curious if this made any change in the long term. Unfortunately capitalism has its way.

### Ethics in Technology

#### [Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-democracy-survive-big-data-and-artificial-intelligence/)

This is crazy to think about much data people create - in 2016 we doubled all of the data in the entire world from 2015 and before. Its crazy to think about how AI can use all this data - in good ways and in bad. I don't think its alarmism to be careful about AI - I mean we've all seen iRobot! I think having data control might be important, but it shouldn't be just kept for like Facebook & Amazon to use just because they are American. I think all companies should be much more responsible with our data, foreign or not.
