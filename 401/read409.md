## Authorization/Authentication Project Ideas

1. Video Games & Tabletop Games owned, added into a database & easily accessible, sorted in several ways, and could randomly pick a game for you, weighted based on your personal rating of it. Perhaps the whole DB could intake games people put & then hold them as an option for other people - expanding our list of games.

2. Customers / Orders - traditional business stuff, where customers could create orders & see their own but not see each others but there would be higher level users that could see more & edit peoples orders etc.
