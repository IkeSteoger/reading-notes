## Authentication

### Explain to a non-technical friend how you would safely hash and store a password

It is similar to hiding a needle in a haystack, you could sift through it and find te needle, but some haystacks are taller, or harder to sift through.

### What is Bcrypt?

An adaptive hash function based on the Blowfish symmetric block cipher cryptographi algorithm & introduces a work factor (security factor), which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be (thehackernews.com)

### Why might you use something like Bcrypt?

Bcrypt while slower is a safer hashing method

### What is Basic Authentication?

BA uses a user name & password when making a request

### What properties are necessary in the header of a Basic Auth request?

A form of `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`

### Define the authentication process to a non-technical recruiter

Its the process of checking the identification of an individual, entity, or website to be who they truly claim to be.

### How should your error messaging respond (both HTTP and HTML)? Why?

A generic message - as to not give too much information to bad actors.

### Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

I see AWS in our future - looking forward to knowing more about the back end! It seems much more my speed vs front end... except maybe user experience. But I think UX is a pretty far back seat at most companies.

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

COMPREHENSION!!! I know I can copy code or visit ChatGPT but I want to actually understand what I am typing and why.
