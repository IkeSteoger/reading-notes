# 401 Reading 02

## Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

### Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter

>Middleware refers to any behind the scenes software that allows two levels to communicate and interact with each other.

### Express the most popular __ __ ____

>Express is the most popular Node web framework.

### Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

>Express has far fewer restrictions on the best way to glue components together to achieve a goal.

### What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

>A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's require() function. Its useful because it allows us to reuse code easily.

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?

>9.6.4

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

>`npm install jshint`

### Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

>Tests are very important because they allow us to make sure all of our code is working. For example, you always want to test food as you make changes to the recipe, because perhaps it will no longer be tasty (or in this case, the code won't work!)

### What are three expected benefits of testing

>significant reductions in defect rates, at the cost of a moderate increase in initial development effort
>these overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects’ final phases
>improved design qualities in the code

### Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

>forgetting to run tests frequently
>writing too many tests at once

### What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

>Smaller code changes
>Fault isolation
>More test reliability

### What is the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

>Continuous deployment is an extension of the continuous delivery concept, which is to automatically deploy every release through the pipeline and into production.

### Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background

>Github helps us maintain continuous deployment because it will push every release into production if you set it up to do so. This requires a lot of communication & collaboration between developers and Github helps keep that organized.

## Things I want to learn more about

>Are tests used in almost all production environments?
