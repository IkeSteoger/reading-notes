## Advanced State with Reducers

### [Extracting State Logic into a Reducer](https://react.dev/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)

#### What is the motivation for adding a reducer?

As components grow in complexity, it can get harder to see at a glance the different ways in which a components state gets updated.

#### What are actions in the context of a reducer? How are they different than setting state directly?

Actions are objects that describe the state they change. Actions are different form settings state directly because they provide a standardized way to describe state changes.

#### What common list operation is useReduce named for, and why?

Its named after the operation `reduce()`, because that operation lets you take an array and "accumulate" a single value out of many.

#### When should you switch from useState to useReducer?

"We recommend using a reducer if you often encounter bugs due to incorrect state updates in some component, and want to introduce more structure to its code. You donâ€™t have to use reducers for everything: feel free to mix and match! You can even useState and useReducer in the same component." (react.dev)
