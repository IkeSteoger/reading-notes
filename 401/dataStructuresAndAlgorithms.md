# 401 Prep: Data Structures and Algorithms

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

>What Operations will be performed and how often they will be executed

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

By ensuring that progress is made toward the basis case(s) in every recursive call. You need at least one branch (i.e. of an if/else statement) that does not make a recursive call.
