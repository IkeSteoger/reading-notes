## AWS Cloud Servers

### What is an EC2 Instance?

Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud, which is a virtual server with varying CPU, memory, storage, and networking compacity.

### Name 2 use cases for EC2

Hosting servers for video games. Development & test enviroments, to test large-scale databases.

### Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com

Flexibility to change underlying EC2 instances.

### Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?

Open the Amazon EC2 console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/>.

### Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL

t2.micro is a lot less vCPUs, RAM, but costs a lot less. t2.xlarge is a lot more vCPUs & RAM but costs much more to run.

### Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend

A compute cycle is the unit of measurement for the performance of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). It is the time it takes for the CPU to do a single instruction.

### What is Elastic Beanstalk?

Elastic Beanstalk allows you to quickly deploy & manage applications in the AWS cloud without having to learn about the infrasturcture that those applications run on.

### Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk

Beanstalk is one layer of abstraction away from the EC2 layer.

### Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk

Elastic Beanstalk is ideal for developers who want to focus on writing code and deploying applications without worrying about infrastructure management.

### Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

I'm excited to dive into AWS stuff and learn more about servers and backend stuff. I dream of working on an MMO with sockets & all that.

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

Learn how to use AWS correctly without incurring any fees.. lmao
