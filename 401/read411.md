## Event Driven Applications

### What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

EventEmitter [https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter]

### What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

"Using this approach, apps are built with many different units that all speak to and interact with each other. By registering event listeners we can actually reverse the flow of communication between our objects. Rather than on object needing to reach inside another object to trigger a function, our objects can just emit events and whichever objects are listening to those event will process it in the way they have been told to." - digitalocean.com

### Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

I believe EDP would be very useful in the backend of a server using Node.js because you could use those created events all over your program without having to do any extra effort.

### Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

Still very curious about cloud/AWS stuff and how that might work - I think my "logical" coding nature might be better for something of that department, which is why I have mostly loved database stuff (besides associations lmao)

### Things I want to Know more about

I want to know more about Event Driven Programming. How is this different from exporting & importing functions/methods like we've been doing?
