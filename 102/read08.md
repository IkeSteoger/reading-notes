## Operators and Loops

An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. Two types exist: those that purely evalute & those that have effects (like assigning a value).

For example (above), `x` is the variable, `=` is the operator, which assigns the value of 14 to the variable. The expression evaluates to 14.

Loops - a powerful tool of JavaScript. Why would we use a loop in our code? A loop is a quick, easy way to do something repeatedly. Various loop mechanisms allow us to determine the start and end points of the loop. They can repeat any number of times - maybe even zero!

A `for` loop stops executing when the `condition` set by the coder becomes `false` but you KNOW your condition number - you could even omit `condition` and therefore it would always be `true` and loop continuously.

A `while` loop will continuously loop until the `condition` becomes `false` and then it passes control to the statement following the loop. This loop is often used when you DON'T KNOW how many times it will run and want the script to find out.
