## HTML: Structure Those Webpages

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language - and its the backbone of webpages and it's content. Creating this structure is as easy as using a few tags - but it can be incredibly complex too - having things you might never even see on the webpage itself! There are so many reasons to learn and use HTML, not only does it create a structure of the webpage but it could also help you with SEO or analytics!

Three main parts of an HTML element include an opening tag (example below)
> `<p>`

and content of anything, perhaps something like
> `Hello World!`

and finally a closing tag to match the opening tag, ala
> `</p>`

If you want an HTML element to include extra information that doesn't display in the actual content, also known as an Attribute!

A code example is below
> `<p class="This is hidden from view except in the code!">Hello World!</p>`

actually displays simply as

> Hello World!

Semantics (when referring to code) references the meaning of the code itself - what does that collection of symbols & letters actually do??

For example, in HTML
the code `<h1>` is a semantic element that gives text a role of "top heading" or `<p>` is a paragraph body.
