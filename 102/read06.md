## Javascript & How Computers Work

### How Computers Work Notes

>Input: typing, touching, etc
>
>Storage: Holds information in memory
>
>Processing: Processes or changes information from memory with commands (CPU)
>
>Output: Lots of different ways to output, text, photo, video, signals, etc.

Binary is how computers work on the inside, via 1s and 0s. Any number can be represented by 1s and 0s. Or wires - that are on and off!  More wires - more numbers. Everything is represented with numbers. Text. Audio. Video. You often won't work directly with these 1s and 0s often, but they are the backbone of all computer information.

Circuits are what used to modify and process information of 1s and 0s. It translates the numbers into the workable output we all know and love. Many types of circuits to connect together and make even more complex circuits. Thanks to the speed of electricity & the closeness of circuits in today's computers, we can do millions of processes per seconds.

Variables in JavaScript are containers for storing data or storing data values.
There are four different variables `var` `let` `const` and using nothing (or an undeclared variable)

To declare a variable is to assign it data or a value, such as `var x = 5` so now x is equal to 5 in the data.

The assignment operator `=` is not akin to traditional math, JavaScript rather sees it as "assign this data/value to x"

Information received from the user is called User Input.
