## Programming With JavaScript

Control flow is the order a computer executes statements in a code script. Typically from first line to the last line, unless the code has structure that changes the control flow, which it often does (examples: conditionals and loops!)

A JavaScript Function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. This function is executed when "something" calls upon it. Code Example of a function below

>function name(parameters){
>
>// function to be executed
>
>}

A `return` statement will stop the function from executing & if the function was invoked from a statement, JS will "return" to execute the code. Functions often compute a `return value` which is sent back to the `caller`.

Therefore to invoke a function, or to call a function, essentially is asking the computer to execute the function (block of code) & carry out the task it was designed for.

The parenthesis when you define a function will include parameter names, which can be separated by commas. Parameter names can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and $$$. The code to be executed is within curly brackets.
