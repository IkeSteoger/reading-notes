## Text Editors

When seeking out a text editor, four important features to seek out are as follows;

+ Code Completion
+ Syntax Highlighting
+ Variety of Themes
+ Many extensions
  
Some of the most used and important commands with their uses are below as well:
   >**pwd** - shows the current working directory
   >**ls** - shows a list of the current directory options
   >**cd** - changes directory. if no directory specified, will go to root directory
   >**mkdir** - creates directory in current directory.
   >**touch** - creates a new file in current directory

If you were to perform the code, line by line

    cd projects
    mkdir new-project
    touch new-project/newfile.md
    cd ..
    ls projects/new-project

First, you would change directory to the Projects folder.

Second, it would Make a New Folder within the Projects Folder called New-Project.

Third, it would create a new Markdown file named newfile.

Fourth, it would return to Projects folder.

Fifth, it would list the directories & files within Projects/new-project, which would result in the newfile.md showing up.
