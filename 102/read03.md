## Revisions and the Cloud

GitHub and Git are powerful tools but you must know how to use them and properly sync between a local version & a cloud version. Below you'll find some basic information on the topic.

A Version Control System (VCS) allows you to go back through changes or versions of a file. This is used to revert projects to a previous version if you mess something up, or compare changes. For example, GitHub shows an extensive history of all changes, this is an excellent Version Control System!

Cloning in Git is the method used to copy the repository in question to your specified directory.

### A Few Basic Commands

+ To Track and Stage a file use the code `git add .` after which check it worked with `git status`
+ To create a snapshot or commit your files to Git use `git commit -m "WHY You Changed Things"`
+ To send your changes of files to Github use `git push origin main`
