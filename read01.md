## Markdown: The Text Formatting Language

Markdown is a easy-to-use-and-learn and versitile language designed to add formatting to text. There are so many reasons people use it, a few of them including; portability, usability, and its general popularity around the world. The language is also future proofed & already in use on almost every front you can imagine.

Jumping into some quick tips -
To create a heading you'll use the **\#** sign - but don't forget to leave a blank line before and after! A single **\#** creates the largest heading. Adding more **\#** creates smaller headings, all the way to **\######** (6 x **\#**).
When adding formatting such as bold or underlined text, its typically best practice to use the **asterisk** ( **\*** ) instead of the *underscore.* ( **\_** )
To create a link in Markdown, you would put the displayed text in [] brackets and the link within () brackets, see below for example

> \[Google](https://google.com/) results with [Google](https://google.com/)

And last but certainly not least, creating an unordered list you can use one of three options, **\+, \*, or \-** BUT best practice is to always use the same symbol once you've picked one - for readability! (ordered list is easy, just use numbers with a period!)

That's a basic overview of Markdown. There's still much more to learn & discover - so get out there and do it!
