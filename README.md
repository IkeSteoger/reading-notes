## Growth Mindset

You know when you've got important things to do and you're feeling *nervous*? Convert that nervousness into **CONFIDENCE & EXCITEMENT**! When taking a challenge head on, you will arise to the occasion & strike it down with glorious fortitude. 

1. Faced by an obstacle? Can't find your way over it? Maybe try going around it instead! Explore new options when stumped.
2. Struggling is not always bad - without pain there often no gain[^1].
3. Observe & celebrate others' success and find inspiration for your own growth.

[^1]: But don't forget to ask for help after 15 minutes of struggle in class!
