## Growth Mindset

You know when you've got important things to do and you're feeling *nervous*? Convert that nervousness into **CONFIDENCE & EXCITEMENT**! When faced with a challenge, you will arise to the occasion & strike it down with glorious fortitude. 

1. Faced by an obstacle? Can't find your way over it? Maybe try going around it instead! Explore new options when stumped.
2. Struggling is not always bad - without pain there cannot be a gain. But don't forget to ask for help!
3. Observe & celebrate others' success and find inspiration for your own growth.
